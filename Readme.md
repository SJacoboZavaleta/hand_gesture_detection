## Project Description

This project is a hand gesture recognition system that uses a webcam to capture video input and a ML-based model to recognize the hand gestures. The system can be used for various applications such as sign language recognition, gesture-based control, and more. The project is built using Python and the libraries such as Pytorch, OpenCV, Scikit-learn and mediapipe. The project is part of the course *"Computer Vision"* at the Carlos III University of Madrid. 

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src/`: Source code for the project.
- `data/`: Data for the project.
- `Readme.md`: This readme file.

## Installation

1. Install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the following command to train the model:

```bash
python src/train_classifier1.py
```

3. Run the following command to interact with the classifier:

```bash
python src/interact_classifier.py
```
4. Run the following command to collect new images and train the model:

```bash
python src/collect_images.py
```
